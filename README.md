# Evaluation Framework for Network Tariffs (EFf-NeTs)
The **E**valuation **F**ramework **f**or **Ne**twork **T**ariff**s** (EFf-NeTs) is a framework that rates different alternatives of network tariffs according to the following criteria:
* Reflection of usage-related costs,
* Reflection of capacity-related costs,
* Fairness and customer acceptance,
* Expansion of DER,
* Efficient electricity usage.

It therefore requires certain input parameters, that have to be generated previous to the execution of the framework.
